# 🧠 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Node.js + Prisma

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is an architectural approach that puts the **business domain at the center** of the application. It encourages modeling your code around the real-world concepts and behaviors it represents — not just data structures or frameworks.

---

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're building software for a **hospital**. You don’t start by thinking in tables or routes — you think in terms of **Patients**, **Doctors**, **Appointments**, and **Billing**. These are not just data — they have rules, workflows, and behaviors.

DDD models these **domain concepts** as code and makes sure the logic lives where it belongs: **in the domain**, not scattered across routes or controllers.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Complex business logic that evolves over time
- Applications with rich domain rules or workflows
- Enterprise-grade systems or multi-team codebases
- Systems where **clarity, modularity, and testability** matter
- Projects with multiple subdomains (e.g., billing, users, inventory)

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- Focuses your app around **core business logic**
- Improves **code clarity** by using the language of the domain
- **Easier to test and maintain** due to layered separation
- Scales well as logic and teams grow
- Reduces long-term complexity by **organizing logic cleanly**

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- More **boilerplate** and setup than simpler patterns
- Slower at first — especially for small projects or MVPs
- Needs **discipline and consistency** in naming and structure
- Can be **overkill for basic CRUD-only apps**

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep domain logic in `domain/` — not in routes or services
- Separate **infrastructure** (e.g. Prisma) from business logic
- Use **repositories** for DB access, **services** for orchestration
- Use `application/` for use cases like "RegisterUser", not random helpers
- Design domain models to **express behavior**, not just data

## 🗂️ Recommended Project Structure (Node.js + Prisma)

app/
├── api/                # HTTP handlers (interface layer)
src/
├── domain/             # Core domain models and interfaces (Entities, Repos)
├── application/        # Use cases / business logic orchestration
├── infrastructure/     # DB implementations (e.g. Prisma)


---

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Repository Pattern** – Abstracts DB logic behind an interface
- **Service Layer** – Coordinates logic between entities and infrastructure
- **Data Mapper** – Maps domain models to persistence layer (e.g. Prisma)
- **CQRS** – Splits reads and writes; often used with DDD

---

> Use DDD when your app is about **behaviors, rules, and workflows** — not just saving stuff to the database. It takes more upfront effort but pays off big as the domain grows in complexity.
