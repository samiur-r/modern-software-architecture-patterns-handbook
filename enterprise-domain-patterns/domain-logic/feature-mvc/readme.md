# 🧠 Feature-Based MVC Architecture with Node.js + Prisma

**Feature-Based MVC** is a modular architectural style that combines the clarity of the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** pattern with the scalability and maintainability of **feature-oriented project structure**.

Instead of separating code by technical concerns (e.g., all controllers in one folder), it groups files by **features/domains** — such as `user`, `auth`, or `product` — making it easier to scale and maintain as your application grows.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a large department store. Each department (e.g., Clothing, Electronics, Groceries) is self-contained — with its own staff, rules, and tools. You don’t organize everything by "Cashiers" or "Managers", you organize by **what the department does**.

In Feature-Based MVC, **each feature is like a department** — it owns everything related to it: routes, controllers, services, schemas, and repositories.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Full-stack Node.js apps with growing features
- REST APIs or microservices
- Teams working on multiple domains in parallel
- Projects requiring **modular separation**, but not full DDD overhead
- Systems where clear **ownership of feature logic** matters

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Modular and scalable** — each feature lives in its own folder
- **Easier onboarding** — devs can focus on a single feature at a time
- Promotes **separation of concerns** via MVC layering
- **Flexible and clean structure** for small to large teams
- Reduces clutter and avoids global controller/service/model folders

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- Slightly more setup than basic flat folder structures
- Requires **discipline in structuring each feature similarly**
- Not as opinionated or "pure" as Clean Architecture or DDD
- May need occasional cross-feature coordination for shared logic

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Organize your code by **feature/domain**, not technical type
- Use Zod (or similar) for schema validation in each module
- Use services for business logic, controllers for I/O logic
- Keep Prisma (or other infra tools) abstracted in repository files
- Use `index.ts` barrel files to simplify imports

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **MVC** – Separates app into Models, Views, Controllers
- **Modular Monolith** – Single app, feature-separated
- **Clean Architecture** – Further layered (Entities, UseCases, etc.)
- **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** – Swappable input/output boundaries
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – Full domain modeling with aggregates, value objects, etc.

---

> Use **Feature-Based MVC** when you want **clarity, modularity, and scalability** — without the boilerplate and complexity of full DDD or Clean Architecture. It’s great for modern backend apps where features evolve quickly, but codebase quality still matters.
