# 🧠 Functional Programming Patterns

This block provides concise explanations of key **functional programming (FP)** concepts with real-world relevance. These principles help create cleaner, more modular, testable, and predictable code.

## 🔁 Currying

**Currying** is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.  
This allows for **partial application**—supplying some of the arguments now and the rest later.

### ✅ Benefits

- Encourages reusability and modular design
- Enables function composition
- Simplifies function customization for different contexts

---

## 🧊 Immutability

**Immutability** means that data cannot be changed once it's created. Instead of modifying existing data structures, new ones are created with the updated values.

### ✅ Benefits

- Prevents unintended side effects
- Makes functions pure and predictable
- Facilitates debugging, testing, and concurrency safety
- Enables features like undo/redo and state time-travel

---

## 📦 Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)

A **Higher-Order Function** is a function that takes another function as an argument, returns a function, or both.  
This pattern lies at the heart of functional programming, allowing abstraction over behavior.

### ✅ Benefits

- Enables flexible logic injection (e.g., access control, retries)
- Promotes code reuse and composition
- Forms the foundation for patterns like map, filter, reduce, and middleware

---

## ⚡ Memoization

**Memoization** is an optimization technique where the results of function calls are cached, so that subsequent calls with the same inputs return the cached result instead of recalculating.

### ✅ Benefits

- Improves performance for expensive or frequently repeated computations
- Useful in UI rendering, data transformations, and mathematical computations
- Enhances responsiveness in client-side applications

---

## ⚙️ Middleware

**Middleware** is a chainable, composable pattern that allows behaviors to be applied before, after, or around core logic.  
Commonly used in web servers, API handlers, and state management systems.

### ✅ Benefits

- Decouples cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and error handling
- Promotes cleaner, layered architecture
- Makes code more extensible and testable

| Concept                    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Currying**               | Breaks a function into a series of single-argument functions |
| **Immutability**           | Ensures data remains unchanged after creation                |
| **Higher-Order Functions** | Operate on or return other functions as values               |
| **Memoization**            | Caches results to avoid redundant calculations               |
| **Middleware**             | Applies processing layers around core functionality          |
