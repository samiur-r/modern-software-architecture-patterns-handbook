# 🧱 Structural Design Patterns

**Structural design patterns** focus on how classes and objects are **composed** to form larger, more flexible structures. They help ensure that components are well-organized and maintainable by defining clear relationships between them.

These patterns improve code **readability**, **flexibility**, and **reusability** by handling things like inheritance, interface compatibility, wrapping, and object composition.

---

## 🧩 Purpose of Structural Patterns

- Simplify **complex structures** into manageable layers
- Enable **interface compatibility** between otherwise unrelated classes
- Promote **loose coupling** between components
- Facilitate **object reuse**, delegation, and composition
- Provide a clear separation between **abstraction and implementation**

## 📦 Patterns Included

| Pattern             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔌 [Adapter](../adapter/README.md)           | Converts one interface into another expected by the client.           |
| 🎁 [Decorator](../decorator/README.md)       | Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically at runtime.             |
| 🧱 [Facade](../facade/README.md)             | Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.              |
| 🛡️ [Proxy](../proxy/README.md)               | Controls access or adds behavior to another object.                  |
| 🌳 [Composite](../composite/README.md)       | Treats individual and composite objects uniformly in tree structures. |

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Building **graphical user interfaces**
- Integrating **third-party APIs** or **legacy code**
- Wrapping or adapting **incompatible systems**
- Implementing **object trees**, such as file systems or component hierarchies
- Optimizing **performance** through sharing or lazy loading
- Structuring **complex subsystems** behind simple interfaces

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- Encourages **clean code organization** and **modularity**
- Makes systems more **scalable and maintainable**
- Promotes **interface-based design** and **composition over inheritance**
- Enables better **interoperability** between new and existing components

---

## ⚠️ Considerations

- May introduce **additional abstraction layers**
- Overuse can lead to **unnecessary complexity**
- Requires careful planning to avoid **performance issues or deep object chains**

## 🔗 Related Pattern Categories

- **Creational Patterns** – Focus on object instantiation (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Builder)
- **Behavioral Patterns** – Focus on communication between objects (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Command)
