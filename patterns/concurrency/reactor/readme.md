# ⚡ Reactor Pattern – Event-Driven Concurrency Explained

The **Reactor Pattern** is a design pattern used to handle **concurrent I/O-bound tasks** efficiently using an **event-driven architecture**. It enables applications to serve thousands of simultaneous connections with minimal resource usage, making it ideal for high-performance servers, real-time systems, and modern frameworks like Node.js.

---

## 🧠 What is the Reactor Pattern?

The Reactor Pattern revolves around an **event loop** that waits for events (like network requests or file changes) and dispatches them to appropriate **event handlers**. It avoids blocking threads by reacting only when an event is ready to be processed.

---

## 🏗️ Core Components

- **Event Loop**: Continuously listens for events and dispatches them.
- **Event Demultiplexer**: Interfaces with the OS to detect I/O events (e.g., `epoll`, `select`, `kqueue`).
- **Event Handlers**: Application logic that runs in response to specific events (e.g., handling a request or incoming message).

---

## 🧩 Real-Life Analogy

Think of a **receptionist** at a busy hotel. Instead of running around completing every task themselves, they wait at the front desk, respond when a guest approaches, and delegate tasks to appropriate staff. This is how the event loop operates in a reactor-based system.

## 💡 When to Use It

Use the Reactor Pattern when:

- You need to handle **many concurrent clients** or connections
- Your system is **I/O-bound** (network, disk, database)
- You want to maximize performance using **non-blocking** operations
- You’re building **real-time applications** (e.g., chat apps, live notifications)

---

## 📦 Common Use Cases

- High-performance HTTP servers
- WebSocket/chat servers
- Notification systems
- Multiplayer game backends
- File watchers and data streamers
- IoT data collectors

---

## ✅ Benefits

- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of concurrent connections with few threads
- **Non-blocking**: Efficient use of CPU and memory
- **Event-driven**: Clean separation of concerns between I/O detection and processing
- **Reactive**: Enables responsive and fast applications

---

## ❌ Limitations

- More complex control flow compared to synchronous/threaded designs
- Debugging async behavior can be harder
- Less suitable for **CPU-intensive** operations (better paired with worker pools)
- Requires careful error handling and flow management

## 🆚 Reactor vs Thread-per-Request

| Feature           | Reactor Pattern      | Thread-per-Request      |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Thread Usage      | Few shared threads   | One thread per request  |
| Blocking Behavior | Non-blocking         | Blocking                |
| Scalability       | High                 | Limited by thread count |
| Memory Efficiency | Excellent            | Poor under heavy load   |
| Code Complexity   | Higher (async logic) | Lower (linear logic)    |

---

## 🔧 Frameworks and Libraries Using the Reactor Pattern

- **Node.js** (JavaScript / TypeScript)
- **Netty** (Java)
- **Spring WebFlux / Project Reactor** (Java, Reactive Streams)
- **asyncio** and **Tornado** (Python)
- **libuv** (C/C++ – used by Node.js)
- **Boost.Asio** (C++)
