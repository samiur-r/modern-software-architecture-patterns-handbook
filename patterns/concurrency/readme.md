# 🧩 Concurrency Patterns

**Concurrency Patterns** help structure applications that need to perform multiple tasks at the same time — without blocking or overloading system resources.

These patterns are useful in both frontend and backend systems, especially when dealing with **I/O operations**, **multithreading**, or **asynchronous workflows**.

This section covers:

- **Thread Pool**
- **Actor Model**
- **Futures / Promises**
- **Reactor**

---

## ⚙️ 1. Thread Pool

A **Thread Pool** is a collection of pre-instantiated threads that can be reused to execute tasks concurrently without the overhead of constantly creating and destroying threads.

**Best For**:

- High-performance server apps
- Controlling concurrency level
- Reducing thread management overhead

---

## ⚙️ 2. Actor Model

The **Actor Model** structures your app as a collection of isolated entities called **actors** that:

- Hold their own state
- Communicate via **message passing**
- Never share memory directly

**Best For**:

- Distributed systems
- Highly concurrent applications
- Resilient and fault-tolerant services

---

## ⚙️ 3. Futures / Promises

**Futures** (or **Promises**) represent a **placeholder for a value** that will become available in the future — used to model asynchronous operations.

**Best For**:

- Async I/O (e.g., API calls, file system, DB access)
- Non-blocking workflows
- Chaining async operations cleanly

---

## ⚙️ 4. Reactor

The **Reactor Pattern** is an event-driven design where a single or few threads wait for events (e.g., I/O readiness) and dispatch them to appropriate handlers.

**Best For**:

- High-throughput, non-blocking servers
- Event-loop architectures (e.g., Node.js, Netty)
- Real-time systems (e.g., chat, WebSocket, streaming)

---

## 🧠 Benefits of Concurrency Patterns

- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ Enables parallelism or non-blocking async flows
- ✅ Improves responsiveness and throughput
- ✅ Scales across CPUs or async event queues

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks / Challenges

- ❌ Harder to debug and test
- ❌ Race conditions, deadlocks, and shared state bugs
- ❌ Requires careful error handling and lifecycle management
- ❌ Increased complexity if not abstracted well

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Prefer **immutable data** when sharing across threads
- Use **message passing** or **event-driven models** to avoid shared memory
- Limit concurrency using **semaphores**, **queues**, or **pools**
- Favor **async/await** or **reactive programming** for I/O-bound concurrency
- Monitor thread usage and memory under load

## ✨ Summary

Concurrency patterns help you write software that can do more — faster, and often more efficiently. Choosing the right pattern depends on whether you’re working with **CPU-bound**, **I/O-bound**, or **distributed workloads**.
