# 🔄 Unit of Work Design Pattern

The **Unit of Work (UoW)** pattern ensures that a group of operations are executed as a **single transactional unit**. If any part of the operation fails, the entire transaction is **rolled back**, preserving **data consistency**.

It’s commonly used in systems that perform **multiple writes or updates** in a single business operation and need to **guarantee atomicity**.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Think of placing an online order:  
You select items, apply a discount, and make a payment. The order isn’t confirmed until **all steps succeed**. If payment fails, the order is canceled. That’s a Unit of Work in action — all or nothing.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- Performing **multiple DB writes** that must succeed or fail together
- Handling **complex workflows** that affect multiple aggregates/entities
- Managing **side effects (e.g., event publishing)** in sync with persistence
- Coordinating **concurrent updates** safely using transactions

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Atomic operations** — all-or-nothing consistency
- **Centralized transaction control**
- **Improves maintainability** by isolating transaction logic
- Works well with **Repository** and **Domain Service** patterns
- Ensures **consistency** across aggregates

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **Extra boilerplate** for small/simple apps
- **Harder to debug** if nested or overly abstracted
- **Requires discipline** around transactional boundaries

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep Unit of Work **short and focused**
- Prefer **explicit transaction boundaries**
- Don’t mix unrelated concerns in one UoW
- Use with **Repository pattern** if managing multiple aggregates
- In microservices, use **Saga** or **Outbox Pattern** for distributed UoWs

---

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Repository Pattern** – Works with UoW to coordinate changes
- **Service Layer** – Executes business operations within UoW
- **Saga Pattern** – Manages distributed transactions in microservices
- **Transaction Script** – Lightweight alternative for simpler workflows

> Use the **Unit of Work pattern** to guarantee **consistency** and **atomicity** in multi-step operations. It’s essential in financial apps, ecommerce, and anywhere transactional integrity matters.
