# 🏢 Enterprise Patterns

**Enterprise patterns** help structure the core logic, data access, and transactional integrity of large-scale, maintainable software systems. These patterns are often used in **backend**, **domain-driven design**, and **enterprise applications** that require modularity, scalability, and testability.

## 📁 Sections

### 🔹 Data Access Patterns

These patterns abstract and organize how your application interacts with **databases or persistence layers**. They promote **separation of concerns** between business logic and data handling.

#### `repository/`

- Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers.
- Treats collections of domain objects like an in-memory collection.
- Common in DDD and Clean Architecture.

#### `dao/` (Data Access Object)

- Provides CRUD access to the database.
- Hides low-level implementation details from higher layers.

#### `active-record/`

- Each domain object is responsible for its own database operations.
- Popular in ORMs like Ruby on Rails, Sequelize.

#### `data-mapper/`

- A separate mapper handles data transfer between the database and domain objects.
- Promotes full separation between database schema and domain model.

---

### 🔹 Transaction Patterns

Used to manage **consistency and atomicity** across multiple operations that should either all succeed or all fail.

#### `unit-of-work/`

- Maintains a list of operations to be performed and executes them in a single transaction.
- Often used alongside Repository and Data Mapper patterns.

---

### 🔹 Domain Logic Patterns

These patterns structure how **business rules** and **domain models** are implemented and maintained in your application.

#### `ddd/` (Domain-Driven Design)

- Focuses on building software around a rich domain model.
- Encourages **ubiquitous language**, **bounded contexts**, and **aggregates**.
- Used in complex systems with deep domain logic.

#### `ecs/` (Entity–Component–System)

- Often used in game development and simulations.
- Composes behavior using components instead of deep inheritance.
- Promotes performance, decoupling, and scalability.

## ✅ Benefits of Enterprise Patterns

- **Decoupling** – Business logic and data logic are separated
- **Testability** – Easier to test domain logic in isolation
- **Maintainability** – Patterns enforce consistent structure across large teams
- **Transactional Integrity** – Ensure consistency across multiple operations
- **Scalability** – Systems built with these patterns scale well over time

## ⚠️ Challenges

- ❌ Increased complexity in early stages of development
- ❌ Requires understanding of domain modeling
- ❌ Boilerplate in some implementations
- ❌ Overengineering if used in simple applications

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use `Repository` with `Unit of Work` for clean separation and consistency
- Avoid mixing data access with domain logic (`Active Record` tradeoff)
- In performance-critical systems, consider `ECS` over OOP models
- Apply `DDD` only where domain complexity justifies it

---

## ✨ Summary

Enterprise patterns help teams **build large, robust, and maintainable backends** with a clear separation between business logic, data logic, and transaction boundaries. Use them to keep your codebase healthy as it grows.
