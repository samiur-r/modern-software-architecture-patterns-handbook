# 🗂️ Repository Design Pattern

The **Repository** pattern provides a **clean separation** between your **domain logic** and **data access logic**. It acts as a **mediator** between the business layer and the data source (e.g., database, API).

It falls under **Architectural Patterns** and is widely used in layered architectures and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **bookstore**. Customers interact with the **salesperson** (repository), not with the **warehouse** (database) directly. The salesperson knows where to find the book, but the customer doesn’t need to know the storage details.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **Database Access Layer** — Abstracting raw SQL/ORM from service logic
- **External API Wrappers** — Hiding API details behind consistent interfaces
- **Unit Testing** — Easily mock data access for testing services
- **Multi-source Aggregation** — Combine data from DB, APIs, and cache
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** — Central to rich domain models

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Decouples business logic from persistence logic**
- **Easier to test** — Repositories are mockable
- **Interchangeable data sources** — Swap database, API, or in-memory
- **Cleaner service code** — Service deals only with domain models
- **Supports caching and batching** behind the scenes

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **Extra abstraction layer** — May be overkill in simple CRUD apps
- **Potential for duplication** — Especially if using ORMs with similar capabilities
- **Verbosity** — Requires more boilerplate (interfaces, classes, etc.)
- **Overengineering risk** — Avoid in small apps unless clear benefit

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use Repository when working with **non-trivial business logic**
- Keep Repository focused only on **data access logic**
- Combine with **interfaces** to enforce consistency and enable mocking
- Use a **Factory or Dependency Injection** to inject concrete implementations
- Keep domain models **free of ORM/DB logic** — let repositories handle persistence

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Factory Pattern** – Used to create repositories based on context (e.g., test vs prod)
- **Unit of Work** – Combine multiple repository actions into one transaction
- **Adapter Pattern** – Repositories can adapt data from external APIs
- **Service Layer** – Often sits above repositories and encapsulates business logic

> Use the Repository Pattern when you want a clean separation of concerns, easier testing, and flexibility in swapping data sources. Keep it lean and purposeful.
