# 🎁 Decorator Design Pattern

The **Decorator** pattern allows you to **add new behavior or responsibilities** to an object **dynamically**, without altering its structure or modifying its code.

It falls under **Structural Design Patterns** and is ideal for extending functionality in a flexible and composable way.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **cup of coffee** ☕. You start with the base (plain coffee), then add optional ingredients like **milk**, **sugar**, **whipped cream**, or **caramel**. Each add-on “decorates” the original coffee, enhancing its flavor and appearance without changing the coffee itself.

That’s the Decorator pattern — wrapping the base object with layers of added behavior.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **UI Components** – Add borders, scrollbars, or shadows to widgets.
- **Middleware Pipelines** – Add logging, authentication, rate limiting.
- **Logging Frameworks** – Extend behavior (log to console + file + cloud).
- **Validation Layers** – Chain form field validators.
- **Text Formatters** – Add bold, italic, underline to base content.

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Open/Closed Principle** — Add new behavior without changing existing code.
- **Composable** — Combine multiple decorators in flexible ways.
- **Avoids subclass explosion** — Use objects instead of deep inheritance trees.
- **Reusable wrappers** — Apply decorators across multiple components.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **Many small classes/functions** — Can lead to class clutter in OOP.
- **Can be hard to debug** — Behavior is spread across layers.
- **Order sensitivity** — The order of decorators affects the final result.
- **Increased complexity** — Can be harder to trace behavior than subclassing.

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use Decorators when you need to **dynamically add responsibilities**.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**.
- Keep decorators **single-purpose** and stackable.
- Use with interfaces or base classes to maintain consistency.

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Adapter** – Converts interface; Decorator adds behavior.
- **Proxy** – Controls access or adds logging; Decorator enhances capabilities.
- **Composite** – Groups objects; Decorator enhances individual objects.
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Similar in structure; passes requests instead of decorating output.
