# 🧠 Strategy Design Pattern

The **Strategy** pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them **interchangeable**. It allows the algorithm to **vary independently** from the client using it.

It falls under **Behavioral Design Patterns** and is ideal when you need to **choose behavior dynamically at runtime**.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're booking a trip and can choose to **drive**, **fly**, or **take a train**. The booking process remains the same — only the **travel strategy** changes.

The travel strategy is separate and interchangeable. That’s the essence of the Strategy pattern.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **Sorting algorithms** – Choose bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, etc.
- **Payment processors** – Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal, etc.
- **Authentication strategies** – Email/password, OAuth, SSO, biometrics.
- **Compression techniques** – Zip, Gzip, Brotli.
- **AI/behavior control** – Different difficulty strategies for bots or enemies.
- **Input validation** – Swap in different rules for various form fields.

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Replaces conditional logic** – Cleaner code than large `if/else` or `switch` blocks.
- **Open/Closed Principle** – Add new behaviors without modifying existing logic.
- **Loose coupling** – Clients are decoupled from concrete strategy implementations.
- **Runtime flexibility** – Strategies can be swapped on the fly.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **More boilerplate** – Introduces extra classes or functions.
- **Overhead** – May be unnecessary for simple logic.
- **Harder to trace logic** – Especially if strategies are deeply abstracted.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use when behavior **varies by context** or **frequently changes**.
- Keep each strategy **single-purpose** and focused.
- Use clear naming conventions (`PayWithStripe`, `ValidateEmail`, etc.).
- Combine with **Factory Pattern** or **Dependency Injection** for better scalability.

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **State Pattern** – Similar structure, but strategy is stateless while state remembers transitions.
- **Template Method** – Strategy uses composition; Template uses inheritance.
- **Command Pattern** – Encapsulates actions; Strategy encapsulates behavior.
- **Factory Pattern** – Can be used to instantiate strategies dynamically.

> 💡 The Strategy Pattern is ideal for situations where your app needs to support multiple algorithms or behaviors that are easily swappable.
