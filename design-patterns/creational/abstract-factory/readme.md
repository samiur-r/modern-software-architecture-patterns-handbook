# 🧰 Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The **Abstract Factory** pattern provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their exact classes.

It falls under **Creational Design Patterns** and is widely used when products from the same "family" need to be created together and kept consistent.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **furniture set** you buy from a store — a matching chair, table, and sofa. You don’t want to mix a modern chair with a vintage sofa. A **furniture factory** provides matching items designed to work together. That’s an Abstract Factory.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **UI Toolkits** – Switch between light/dark themes or Windows/macOS/Linux components.
- **Game Development** – Create themed elements (Sci-fi vs. Fantasy worlds).
- **Cross-platform Apps** – Create consistent UI for different platforms.
- **Product Configurators** – Choose a family of related items from a single source.
- **Dependency Injection Systems** – Provide interchangeable implementations in modules.

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Consistency across families** — Ensures related objects are compatible.
- **Decouples client from concrete classes** — Makes code more flexible and testable.
- **Scalable** — Easily switch between product families without changing client logic.
- **Centralized creation logic** — Cleaner architecture for large systems.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **High complexity** — More interfaces, classes, or factory functions to manage.
- **Rigid structure** — Adding new product types requires changes to all factories.
- **Overengineering risk** — May be unnecessary for small or simple applications.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use Abstract Factory **when you need to create multiple related objects** that must be used together.
- **Avoid hardcoding product families** — rely on abstractions.
- Consider combining with the **Factory Method** or **Builder Pattern** for more complex setups.
- Favor **interface-based design** for easier extension and testing.

- **Factory Method** – Used to create one product; Abstract Factory creates a family of products.
- **Builder Pattern** – Used for step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- **Prototype Pattern** – Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.
