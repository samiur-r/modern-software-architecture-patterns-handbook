# ✍️ CQRS – Command Query Responsibility Segregation

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** is an architectural pattern that **separates read and write responsibilities** into different models. This allows you to optimize each side independently, improve scalability, and manage complex domain logic without compromising query performance.

It’s especially useful in systems that need **custom views, performance-tuned reads**, or **complex business rules** on the write side.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine you're running a **restaurant**:

- **Waiter takes your order** – this changes system state (Command).
- **Customer checks the menu** – this just displays data (Query).

Taking orders and showing menus are two completely different responsibilities — that’s CQRS in action.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- 💸 Financial systems (e.g., banking, trading)
- 🛒 E-commerce platforms (order, cart, product views)
- 📊 Real-time dashboards with high read traffic
- 🧠 Domain-driven business apps with complex rules
- 🏥 Healthcare or insurance with audit and workflow tracking

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- ✅ **Clear separation of concerns** — read and write logic are isolated
- 📈 **Scalable and performant** — query models can be denormalized and optimized
- 🧪 **Easier testing** — commands can be unit-tested independently of queries
- 📦 **Supports multiple read models** — great for dashboards and custom views
- 🔁 **Pairs well with Event Sourcing** — rebuild read models from events

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- ⚠️ **Added complexity** — two models, often two databases or schemas
- 🔁 **Eventual consistency** — reads may lag behind writes
- 🧵 **Debugging is trickier** — involves tracing through commands and projections
- 📐 **Overkill for simple apps** — CRUD apps don’t benefit much

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Design **write models for domain logic**, **read models for performance**
- Use **event handlers** or **change data capture** to update read models
- Embrace **eventual consistency** in distributed systems
- Consider **Event Sourcing** to persist all domain changes
- Use **projections** or **materialized views** for fast queries

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Event Sourcing** – Persist state as a series of events
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – Provides strategic guidance for modeling commands
- **Event-Driven Architecture** – Helps propagate state changes asynchronously
- **Materialized Views** – Read-side data shaped for fast access
- **Service Bus / Event Bus** – Enables loosely coupled communication

---

> Use **CQRS** when your application needs to handle **complex commands**, **serve custom queries efficiently**, or **scale reads and writes independently**. It’s ideal for domain-driven systems, enterprise apps, and modern microservices environments.
