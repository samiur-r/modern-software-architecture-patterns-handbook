# 🧩 Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture

The **MVVM** pattern separates an application into three layers: **Model**, **View**, and **ViewModel**. It promotes a reactive and testable architecture, commonly used in modern UI development frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, **Angular**, and **Android Jetpack**.

---

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **smart mirror** at your gym:

- The **Model** is your fitness tracker that knows your step count, weight, and goals.
- The **ViewModel** transforms that data into something meaningful — like “75% of your goal achieved.”
- The **View** (mirror screen) just displays what the ViewModel sends it. It never talks directly to the Model.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **Web Applications** using frameworks like React, Vue, Angular
- **Mobile Apps** using Android Jetpack (ViewModel + LiveData/StateFlow)
- **Apps with complex UI states** (e.g., filtering, sorting, multi-step flows)
- **UIs with reactive data binding**

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **Separation of concerns** – View, state logic, and business logic are neatly decoupled.
- **Highly testable** – ViewModel contains logic and state, easily testable without UI.
- **Cleaner views** – Views become simple, declarative renderers.
- **Great for reactive systems** – MVVM fits naturally with reactive programming and data-binding.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **Boilerplate** – May require more files and structure than smaller apps need.
- **ViewModel bloat** – Risk of too much logic accumulating in the ViewModel.
- **Learning curve** – Especially when combining with advanced reactive tools (RxJS, StateFlow, etc.)
- **Indirect navigation flow** – View may feel too detached if not managed properly.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep **ViewModel logic focused on UI-related state** (not general business logic).
- Don’t access **DOM or framework-specific APIs** in ViewModel.
- Use **binding or subscriptions** to observe ViewModel data in the View.
- Delegate non-UI-related logic to **Services or Use Cases**.
- For frontend apps, **encapsulate ViewModel in hooks or composables**.

---

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** – An older structure where Controller handles input.
- **MVP (Model–View–Presenter)** – Presenter drives the View directly, used in UI-heavy apps.
- **Clean Architecture** – MVVM often forms the outer layer of Clean Architecture in frontend/mobile apps.
- **Redux (State Management)** – Redux-like stores often act like ViewModels in a global context.

## 📦 Sample Component Breakdown (React)

| Layer         | Role                                             | Example File                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Model**     | Fetch exchange rates or data from DB/API         | `CurrencyModel.ts`          |
| **ViewModel** | Holds state, handles logic, talks to Model       | `useCurrencyViewModel.ts`   |
| **View**      | UI component that displays state and takes input | `CurrencyConverterView.tsx` |

---

## ✨ Summary

MVVM helps build **scalable, testable, and maintainable UIs** by separating responsibilities:

- **Model** → business logic / data
- **ViewModel** → state and presentation logic
- **View** → UI, binds to ViewModel

This pattern shines in **reactive and modern frontend development**.
