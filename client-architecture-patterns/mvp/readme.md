# 🧩 Model-View-Presenter (MVP) Architecture

The **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architecture is a design pattern that separates an application into three components: **Model**, **View**, and **Presenter**.

It’s an evolution of the classic MVC pattern, designed to improve testability and decouple UI logic from presentation logic.

## 🔍 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **news anchor** on television:

- The **Script (Model)** contains all the facts and content.
- The **Anchor (View)** simply reads and displays the script to the audience.
- The **Teleprompter operator (Presenter)** controls what the anchor sees and when.

The anchor doesn’t decide what to show — they follow what the teleprompter presents. That’s MVP in action.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **Android app development** – MVP is widely used in legacy or test-driven Android apps.
- **Desktop applications** – Platforms like WinForms or WPF.
- **UI-heavy apps** – Where logic needs to be separated from views for clarity and testability.
- **Legacy web apps** – Especially those with imperative DOM manipulation or jQuery-based UIs.

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- **View is passive** – Handles UI only, making it reusable and easy to test.
- **High testability** – Presenter can be unit tested without relying on the UI.
- **Separation of concerns** – Business logic (Model), Presentation logic (Presenter), and UI (View) are clearly divided.
- **Platform independence** – Presenters can be reused across platforms with different UIs.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- **Boilerplate-heavy** – Lots of interface definitions and manual wiring.
- **Presenter bloat** – Can grow large and complex if not managed properly.
- **Overhead for simple apps** – Adds complexity where a lighter pattern would suffice.
- **Manual binding** – No automatic data-binding like MVVM unless added manually.

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Use interfaces to decouple **View from Presenter**.
- Keep **Presenter logic focused** on orchestrating View updates and handling user actions.
- Delegate business logic to the **Model or Use Cases/Services**.
- Avoid putting UI-specific code inside the Presenter.
- Keep the **View “dumb”** — it should only handle rendering and delegating events.

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** – MVP is derived from it with more testability focus.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** – Great for reactive or data-binding environments (e.g., Android Jetpack, Angular).
- **Clean Architecture** – Separates application layers and is compatible with MVP-like structures.
- **VIPER** – An evolution of MVP with even more modular separation, common in iOS.
